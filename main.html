        <div class="next">
            <p>
                We aim to provide a culture that supports our students in developing their character to its fullest potential and to achieve excellence across a broad range of academic curricular and co-curricular programs.

                We encourage the individual and celebrate as a collective.  We understand that our achievements reflect positively on us all, our achievements represent. 
                Represent our academy, represent our parents and families and represent our individual character.
                
                We have unapologetically high expectations – and as a result our students succeed personally, and we are proud.
                
                We have incredibly high expectations of behaviour. 
                Our students are happy, they are polite and show respect. 
                Our behaviour systems promote a discipline within our students that prepares them fully for the world beyond the academy. As an academy, as a community we achieve academic excellence, develop strength of individual character supported by our culture of aspiration and celebrating success. 
                Our rewards system recognises the success of our students through achievement points, Golden Tickets, half colours and full colours.  
                Achievement and progress are rewarded within every lesson.  
            </p>

        <h1>Disabilities</h1>
        <p>
            At Mascalls Academy, we believe that all our young people are entitled to receive a high-quality education regardless of their needs or disabilities. 
            To enable our young people to do this it is vital that they are equipped with the tools needed to become independent learners, both inside and outside of the classroom. 
            Our young people will be given the opportunity to become digitally literate and independent using our Chromebooks and assistive technology. 
            They will be encouraged and supported to improve their disciplinary and digital literacy through targeted interventions, assistive technology and a whole school pedagogy focusing on improving literacy for all. 
            Intervention and support will challenge and focus through scaffolding so that our young people reach their full potential in their time with us at Mascalls
            Academy.
        </p>
